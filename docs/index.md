# OSG Management

This is the Open Science Grid (OSG) Management website, providing information about the management structure and activities of the OSG
Consortium.

A much older and now out-of-date version of the OSG Management website is still available
[on the OSG TWiki](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Management/WebHome?rev=153),
but it will be removed at the end of 2017.


## Management Overview

The OSG is managed by three key groups, with substantial overlaps in personnel between the groups:

* **OSG Council** &ndash; a group of key stakeholders and the governing body of the OSG Consortium (for more information, [visit the OSG Council website](https://opensciencegrid.github.io/council/))

* **OSG Executive Team** &ndash; manages the program of work and priorities of the OSG Project (see below)

* **OSG Area Coordinators** &ndash; as leads of OSG functional areas, perform detailed planning and tracking (for more information, [visit the OSG Area Coordinators page](/management/area-coordinators/))


## Executive Team

The OSG Executive Team manages the program of work and priorities of the OSG Project, as well as contributions from OSG
Consortium members.

Current Executive Team members:

* Frank Würthwein, University of California San Diego, OSG Executive Director
* Miron Livny, University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, OSG Technical Director and PI
* Brian Bockelman, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, OSG Technology lead
* Burt Holzman, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab representative
* David Swanson, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, OSG Council chair
* Eric Lançon, Brookhaven National Laboratory, ATLAS representative
* Mark Neubauer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, OSG Resource Manager
* Rob Gardner, University of Chicago, OSG User and Campus Support lead
* Rob Quick, Indiana University, OSG Operations lead
* Tim Cartwright, University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison, OSG Chief of Staff


## Management Activities

Major activities of OSG management teams include:

* An annual planning retreat.  At this two-day meeting near the start of each fiscal year, strategies, goals, and plans
  for the coming year and beyond are reviewed, discussed, debated, and settled on.

* A work-breakdown structure (WBS).  Stemming from the annual planning retreat and maintained throughout the year is a
  standard WBS of high-level goals and objectives, including deliverables and milestones.  The Executive Director and
  Chief of Staff select key goals to monitor during the year, and Area Coordinators report progress on and update the
  WBS documents periodically.

* OSG Council meetings.  These are scheduled quarterly (two per year in person, two by conference call) and generally
  include comprehensive reviews of all OSG areas and goals.  Members from outside the OSG provide valuable insight into
  stakeholder needs, the cyberinfrastructure environment, and funding opportunities, and advise OSG management.

* OSG Executive Team meetings.  The team meets weekly to check in on key projects and discuss particular challenges.

* OSG Area Coordinator meetings.  Also weekly, one or two Area Coordinators present on recent accomplishments, update
  the group on the status of WBS goals, and discuss current or foreseeable challenges.  Because every OSG functional
  area is represented, this is a great venue to discuss cross-area issues.
