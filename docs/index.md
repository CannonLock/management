# OSG Management Area

Welcome to the home page of the OSG Management Team documentation area!  This is currently a work in progress as we
migrate our TWiki documentation to GitHub.  If you are looking for our full documentation, please visit the
[TWiki](https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Management).


## Organization

The Management Plan, By-laws, and official reports are stored in the official
[Document Repository](http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/DocumentDatabase/).

The OSG Organization structure is described
[here](http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/0003/000314/008/6.OSG%20Management%20Plan.pdf). The concept and
classification of Satellite projects is described
[here](https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Management/OSGSatelliteProjects). The OSG Computer Science Student
Fellowship is described
[here](https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=831&version=2&filename=OSG%20CS%20Student%20Fellowship.pdf).

The Calendar for Consortium and other OSG collaboration meetings is in
[Indico](http://indico.fnal.gov/categoryDisplay.py?categId=86).


## Work Plan and Tracking

The OSG Planning process includes a WBS with the high level tasks (deliverables and milestones).  The WBS is maintained
by the Project Manager and updated on a quarterly basis by the responsible person for each task area.  Each Area
Coordinator then maintains more detailed task and action lists and plans.  These relate to the items in the WBS and are
developed to a hierachy as appropriate.  Area Coordinators work with the Project Manager to review their work for
consistency with the WBS.  The WBS is modified as needed to include any new work identified.

**Please view the Area Coordinators [Meeting and Calendar](area-coordinators.md)**

## Computer Science Student Fellowships

The OSG Computer Science Student Fellowship provides for one year of funding to a graduate or undergraduate student in
Computer Science.  The fellowship provides funding for up to 20 hours a week for computer science research of value both
to the OSG and the broader community.  The Fellowship is offered for the institutions that are funded as part of the OSG
project at the time of application and delivery of the research.

The OSG Computer Science Student Fellowship is described
[here](https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=831&version=2&filename=OSG%20CS%20Student%20Fellowship.pdf).
Please contact the [Executive Team](mailto:osg-et@opensciencegrid.org) if you are interested in this opportunity.
