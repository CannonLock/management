# OSG General Management Policies

This page contains general OSG policies that apply across the project, mostly intended for internal use.

## Staff Departures

When an OSG staff member departs the project:

- The site PI for that staff member must inform the Executive Director and the Chief of Staff with the name of the
  person and their last day on the staff, ideally with a bit of warning (like a week).

- The Chief of Staff (or Executive Director as necessary) will announce the departure to all Area Coordinators by email,
  again ideally with a bit of warning.

- Each Area Coordinator will have a documented procedure for handling the staff departure within their area, including
  removal or lowering of privileges, updating documents, etc. The Chief of Staff and the Security Officier will review
  the procedure documents at times, so they should be kept up-to-date.

- Once notified, each Area Coordinator is responsible for their area completing the procedure within one business week
  of the departure date.  If circumstances prevent the work from being completed within that time, the Area Coordinator
  will discuss with the Chief of Staff and Executive Director the reasons for the delay, risks associated with leaving
  privileges (and so forth) intact for longer, and a planned completion date.
